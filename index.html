    <h1>The Future</h1>
    
    <p><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></p>
    <p>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was announced as the successor to the PlayStation 4 in April 2019, was launched on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, and was released worldwide a week later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S consoles, which were released in the same month.

        The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, as a lower-cost model for buying games only through download. The two variants were launched simultaneously. Slimmer hardware revisions of both models replaced the original models on sale in November 2023.[4] A PlayStation 5 Pro model is planned for release on November 7, 2024, featuring a faster GPU, improved ray tracing, and introducing an AI-driven upscaling technology.</p>
